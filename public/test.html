<p>In a low-key video released on the X17 YouTube channel, Ye confirmed that he is running for president.</p>
<p>The man filming was invited into one of Ye’s design studios, and they talked casually.</p>
<p>This other video from the same happening was also posted.</p>
<p><div class="fluid-width-video-wrapper" style="padding-top: 56.3107%;"><iframe loading="lazy" title="EXCLUSIVE - Ye Says &quot;We're God's iPhone,&quot; Talks Sustainable Housing And &quot;Getting Past The Past&quot;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FkZpMZzsOps?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" name="fitvid1"></iframe></div></p>
<p>Ye was with Milo Yiannopoulos, who he said is working on his campaign with him.</p>
<p>Yiannopoulos has said a lot of negative things about me over the years, but he’s been better more recently, having allegedly stopped being gay, and I certainly have no reason to wish him anything other than all the best on this endeavor. I just hope he’s not working with the cops, I hope he’s got Ye’s back, and that he remembers my boy Nick.</p>
<p>It’s a little bit strange that he attacked me for saying all the same things Ye is now saying.</p>
<p>On some level, I’m glad Milo got a break. His canceling was absurd, and he was always at least entertaining, which is a lot more than I can say about most of these people from 2016.</p>
<p>Ye appears to be a good judge of character, so I’m sure if Milo creates problems, he’ll sniff it out quick.</p>
<p>In other news, the Daily Stormer has yet to make an official endorsement of a presidential candidate for 2024.</p>
<p>Look for that.</p>
